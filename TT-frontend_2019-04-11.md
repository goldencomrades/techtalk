### What we will talk about?
- Reactive Programming
- RxJS library (https://rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com/api)

The essential concepts in RxJS which solve async event management are:

**Observable**: represents the idea of an invokable collection of future values or events.

**Observer**: is a collection of callbacks that knows how to listen to values delivered by the Observable.

**Subscription**: represents the execution of an Observable, is primarily useful for cancelling the execution.

**Operators**: are pure functions that enable a functional programming style of dealing with collections with operations like map, filter, concat, reduce, etc.

**Subject**: is the equivalent to an EventEmitter, and the only way of multicasting a value or event to multiple Observers.

**Schedulers**: are centralized dispatchers to control concurrency, allowing us to coordinate when computation happens on e.g. setTimeout or requestAnimationFrame or others.
